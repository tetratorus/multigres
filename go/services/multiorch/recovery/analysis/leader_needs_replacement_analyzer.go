// LeaderNeedsReplacementAnalyzer judges a shard's leader/durability situation and
// emits at most one shard-level problem per cycle. It reasons on two axes:
//
//   - Does the leader need replacing, and why? Either healthy (empty cause) or one
//     of LeaderResigned / LeaderUnhealthy / LeaderUnreachableByCohort, chosen by
//     the first-hand vs observer-derived evidence principle (see the leader problem
//     docs in the types package). Observer-derived causes are quorum-gated; first-
//     hand ones are not.
//   - Could a failover succeed? Only if a durability-sufficient set of reachable,
//     initialized poolers is available to recruit a replacement.
//
// Crossing the leader verdict with failover feasibility (non-actionable outcomes are
// alert-only):
//   - replace + feasible   → the cause code (actionable → AppointLeader).
//   - replace + infeasible → ShardStuck, or NoHealthyCohortMembers when blind.
//   - healthy              → no problem, or ShardAtRisk if losing the leader would strand the shard.
//   - inconclusive         → LeaderHealthUnknown, or the infeasible codes above when we also can't recruit.
//
// "Feasible" is CheckSufficientRecruitment: a strict majority of the outgoing
// cohort reachable (unique rule number) with the remainder unable to satisfy the
// policy (revocation). For ShardAtRisk we run it excluding the current leader — the
// question is whether we could recover if the leader were lost.
//
// TODO(LeaderStuck): a "leader reachable but quorum-commit not advancing" cause is
// not yet detected — it needs a quorum-commit signal (per-replica lag is not
// quorum-safe).
//
// TODO(pooler-reported health): this analyzer reasons about postgres running/ready
// directly (leaderPostgresReady/Running). Directionally it should trust a pooler's
// self-reported fitness — the pooler knows it is e.g. mid-restart and still fit —
