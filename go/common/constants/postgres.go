	// SessionSourceProbeSQL is the session-state probe run by the multipooler

	// round trip and compares it against the connection's tracked settings label.
	// Three sources are combined, because pg_settings alone cannot see everything
	// (verified on PostgreSQL 17):
	//
	//   - 'session' rows: pg_settings WHERE source = 'session' — every defined
	//     GUC whose current value was installed by this session (SET,
	//     set_config(..., false), including any hidden inside routine bodies).
	//     current_setting() is used instead of pg_settings.setting because it
	//     returns the SHOW-style display form, which is also what set_config

	//     apples-to-apples.
	//     Both pg_settings and current_setting are schema-qualified: pg_temp
	//     is searched before pg_catalog for unqualified relation names, and a
	//     client's search_path could shadow an unqualified function name.
	//   - 'identity' rows: role and session_authorization are GUC_NO_SHOW_ALL —
	//     they NEVER appear in pg_settings — so they are read explicitly.
	//     current_setting('role') reports 'none' when no SET ROLE is in effect;
	//     session_user is the current session authorization.
	//   - 'custom' rows: placeholder GUCs (names with a dot, e.g. 'my.tenant')
	//     are also hidden from pg_settings until an extension defines them, so
	//     every custom name in the tracked label is read explicitly with
	//     current_setting(name, missing_ok := true), which returns NULL when the
	//     session has never seen the GUC.
	//
	// Known blind spot: a custom GUC set behind tracking's back on a connection
	// whose label does not contain it is undetectable — placeholder GUCs cannot
	// be enumerated from SQL. The creation-time rejection gates remain the
	// defense for that class.
