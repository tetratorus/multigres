# Changing the Rules Safely

This is the consensus algorithm from the [overview](consensus-overview.md) at
implementation depth, with the PostgreSQL specifics folded in. It assumes you
have read the overview (the _why_) and [the state model](state-model.md) (the
_vocabulary_ — rules, cohorts, quorum, the revocation promise, positions).

The overview reduces a safe rule change to two steps:

1. **Block any rogue quorum** in the old rule's cohort by recruiting enough
   nodes to pledge they won't participate in the old rule.
2. **Write the rule change** under a unique higher rule number, to both the old
   and new cohorts.

This document shows how those two steps are carried out as a coordinator-driven
RPC protocol — **recruit → build proposal → promote/set-primary** — and what
each step does to a real PostgreSQL instance.

## Purpose and boundary

A rule change installs a new `ShardRule`: a new leader, cohort, or durability
policy, under a new rule number. This doc owns _how that happens safely_. It
does **not** own:

- _When_ a rule change is triggered — failure detection and the decision to act
  live in [recovery.md](recovery.md) (TODO). This doc starts from
  "a coordinator has decided to appoint a leader for this cohort."
- _What the state means_ — `RuleNumber`, `TermRevocation`, `PoolerPosition`,
  etc. are defined in [the state model](state-model.md).

The entry point is
[`Coordinator.AppointLeader`](../../go/services/multiorch/consensus/coordinator.go);
recovery calls it (via `AppointLeaderAction`), and bootstrap calls the sibling
`AppointInitialLeader`.

## The protocol at a glance

A coordinator (a multiorch instance) drives every cohort member through two
RPCs. The leader-to-be gets `Promote`; everyone else gets `SetPrimary`.

```text
coordinator                 cohort member (pooler)
-----------                 ----------------------
  │  Recruit(revocation)  →   stop replication, pledge term N to disk,
  │                           report committed position (rule + LSN)
  │  ← ConsensusStatus
  │
  │  (collect recruits until a safe proposal can be built;
  │   pick the most-advanced recruit as leader)
  │
  │  Promote(proposal)    →   [leader]    pg_promote, write the new rule
  │  SetPrimary(leader,   →   [followers] point primary_conninfo at the
  │             rule)                     new leader (pg_rewind if diverged)
  │  ← responses
```

`Recruit` is step 1 (block rogue quorum). `Promote`/`SetPrimary` is step 2
(write the change to both cohorts). The two RPCs map onto the proto messages in
[consensusdata.proto](../../proto/consensusdata.proto).

## Deriving the new term and the outgoing rule

Before any RPC, the coordinator builds the `TermRevocation` it will propose,
from the cohort's last-known statuses
([`NewTermRevocation`](../../go/common/consensus/revocation.go)):

- `revoked_below_term` = `max(observed terms across the cohort) + 1`. This is
  the overview's "unique higher rule number."
- `outgoing_rule` = the highest `RuleNumber` any cohort member reports — the
  rule the coordinator is transitioning _from_.

Uniqueness of the new term is not guaranteed by `max + 1` alone — two
coordinators could compute the same value. It is enforced during recruitment by
**majority overlap** (below): two coordinators cannot both win the same term
because their recruited sets must intersect, and a pooler accepts only one
coordinator per term.

## Step 1 — Recruit (block the rogue quorum)

The coordinator sends `Recruit(revocation)` to every cohort member concurrently
([`dispatchRecruit`](../../go/services/multiorch/consensus/rule_change.go)). On
the pooler side
([`Recruit`](../../go/services/multipooler/internal/manager/rpc_consensus.go)),
under the action lock:

1. **Validate** the revocation against committed state
   ([`ValidateRevocation`](../../go/common/consensus/revocation.go)) — reject if
   the pooler already committed at or beyond term _N_, or already pledged term
   _N_ to a different coordinator.
2. **Stop replication participation** — this is what makes the pledge real:
   - a **primary** demotes and restarts as a standby (`emergencyDemoteLocked`);
   - a **standby** pauses its WAL receiver and waits for replay to stabilize
     (`waitForReplayStabilize`; see the decision log
     [Wait for WAL Replay to Stabilize During Standby Revoke](decision-log/2026-02-12-wait-for-replay-stabilize-during-revoke.md)).
3. **Re-read** the now-stable position and re-validate (catches a WAL rule entry
   that raced in during the stop).
4. **Persist** the `TermRevocation` to local disk (`AcceptRevocation`) — the
   durable pledge — and **respond** with the pooler's `ConsensusStatus`
   (committed rule + LSN).

The response's position is what lets the coordinator pick the most-advanced
leader. Because the pledge is flushed to disk before the response, a recruited
pooler that crashes and restarts still honors it.

### Why recruitment is enough: majority + revocation

The coordinator only proceeds once the recruited set is large enough, checked by
[`CheckSufficientRecruitment`](../../go/common/consensus/durability.go)
over the **outgoing** cohort. Two thresholds combine:

```text
|recruited| ≥ max(
    ⌊|cohort|/2⌋ + 1,    // majority   — any two recruitments share a pooler
    |cohort| − N + 1,    // revocation — un-recruited set is too small to form an N-quorum
)
```

- **Majority** is what makes the new term unique. Any two concurrent
  recruitments of the same cohort must overlap on at least one pooler, and a
  pooler accepts only one coordinator per term, so at most one coordinator can
  complete a rule change at that term. This is the overview's "majority overlap
  forces a single winner."
- **Revocation** is the overview's rogue-cohort elimination: if `N` or more
  cohort members are _un_-recruited, they could still form their own `N`-quorum
  under the old rule. Requiring fewer than `N` un-recruited makes that
  impossible.

The most-advanced recruit is then a safe leader: because the recruited set
intersects every possible committing `N`-subset of the old cohort, it carries
every transaction that was ever durable under the old rule
([`discoverMostAdvancedTimeline`](../../go/common/consensus/proposals.go)). This
is the overview's "the most advanced transaction history becomes the starting
point — nothing durable is lost." "Most advanced" is well-defined because
positions are totally ordered even across diverged WALs; see
[Total ordering across divergence](state-model.md#total-ordering-across-divergence).

> The coordinator commits to the leader at the **first** moment a safe proposal
> can be built, streaming `Promote` from there rather than waiting for stragglers
> ([`collectRecruitsAndBuildProposal`](../../go/services/multiorch/consensus/rule_change.go)).
> This keeps failover fast. The tradeoff: _uncommitted_ WAL on a slower,
> more-advanced pooler is discarded (via pg_rewind) when it rejoins as a
> follower — safe, because uncommitted writes were never durable.

## Step 2 — Promote and SetPrimary (write to both cohorts)

Once a leader is chosen, the coordinator builds a `CoordinatorProposal` (new
`ShardRule` at the new term, carrying the same `TermRevocation`) and dispatches
it to the whole cohort
([`dispatchPromote`](../../go/services/multiorch/consensus/rule_change.go)):

- the designated leader receives **`Promote`**;
- every other member receives **`SetPrimary`**.

Members that didn't answer `Recruit`, or answered too late to factor into leader
selection, still receive `SetPrimary` so they learn the new term.

### Promote (the leader)

[`Promote`](../../go/services/multipooler/internal/manager/rpc_consensus.go)
requires a prior `Recruit` for the same term — the stored revocation term must
equal the proposal's term, and PostgreSQL must be a standby with no
`primary_conninfo` (proof that `Recruit` ran and no earlier `Promote` did). It
then writes the rule through
[`UpdateRule`](../../go/services/multipooler/internal/manager/consensus/rule_store.go)
with a **promotion hook** that calls `pg_promote()`. Only after the rule write
succeeds does the pooler advertise PRIMARY/SERVING to the gateway — the write is
the durability gate (see below). Opening writes earlier would risk acknowledging
transactions the new cohort can't yet guarantee.

### SetPrimary (the followers)

[`SetPrimary`](../../go/services/multipooler/internal/manager/rpc_consensus.go)
points a follower's replication at the new leader. Its gate is a pure rule
comparison: it applies the change only if the supplied rule is **strictly
higher** than the pooler's own (by `RuleNumber`), otherwise it's a successful
no-op — which makes it safe under retries and out-of-order delivery. It also
honors the revocation promise: if
[`IsRuleRevoked`](../../go/common/consensus/revocation.go) says the incoming
rule is below this pooler's pledged term, it's ignored.

When it does apply:

- a **standby** swaps `primary_conninfo` to the new leader and resumes streaming;
- a node still acting as **primary** is a _stale_ primary — the coordinator knows
  a newer rule with a different leader exists — so it is demoted and restarted as
  a standby, using **pg_rewind** to reconcile any divergence
  (`restartAsStandbyLocked`).

## Committing the change: the durability checkpoint

PostgreSQL has no transactional switch for "which quorum policy is in effect" —
`synchronous_standby_names` is a config setting. The rule store simulates one by
treating the **rule-change write itself as the durability checkpoint**, using a
two-phase GUC transition in
[`UpdateRule`](../../go/services/multipooler/internal/manager/consensus/rule_store.go)
/ [`BuildPolicyTransition`](../../go/common/consensus/durability.go):

1. Apply the **`Both`** policy _before_ the WAL write — a synchronous-standby
   configuration that satisfies the old and new durability requirements
   simultaneously (e.g. the smaller of the two cohorts on a membership change).
2. Write the rule change. This write **blocks until a synchronous-standby
   acknowledges** it. That ack is the checkpoint: once enough nodes confirm the
   rule-change LSN, the new policy has provably taken effect for every
   subsequent transaction.
3. Apply the **`Incoming`** (new) policy _after_ the write commits.

On a promotion the ack only arrives after the full `SetPrimary` round-trip
completes — `Recruit` cleared replication everywhere, so the followers only
reconnect (and start acking) once `SetPrimary` points them at the new leader,
optionally after a pg_rewind. The leader's `Promote` returning success therefore
means the cohort's durability quorum endorsed the new rule: **the change is
committed and irreversible.**

Combined with the revocation pledges from step 1, this is what makes split brain
impossible: revocation eliminates rogue cohorts, and committing only on a
quorum ack ensures no future coordinator can miss that the transition happened.

If the leader dies _between_ writing the rule and reaching that quorum ack, the
change is left in-flight — neither committed nor safe to discard. Completing such
an interrupted rule change is the special case covered in
[Propagating stuck rule transitions](propagation.md).

## Bootstrap and operator override: externally-certified revocation

`AppointInitialLeader`
([coordinator.go](../../go/services/multiorch/consensus/coordinator.go)) handles
a fresh shard, where there is **no outgoing cohort to recruit consent from**.
Instead of the outgoing-quorum check, it uses an
`ExternallyCertifiedRevocation`: the coordinator certifies a `frozen_lsn` (the
most-advanced position observed across the cohort) below which the outgoing
cohort cannot have committed anything. The proposal sets `skip_outgoing_quorum`,
and leader eligibility is floored at `frozen_lsn`
([`BuildExternallyCertifiedProposal`](../../go/common/consensus/proposals.go)).

A **majority** of the _incoming_ cohort is still required, for the same
single-winner reason as failover: it stops two concurrent bootstrap attempts
from both succeeding.

### Operator override: forced failover after a quorum is permanently lost

The same path is the operator/provisioner escape hatch when Multiorch reports
`ShardStuck` (see [When automatic failover is unsafe](recovery.md#when-automatic-failover-is-unsafe)):
the leader must be replaced, but too few outgoing-cohort members are
recruitable to prove revocation, so Multiorch refuses to fail over on its own.

The entry point is `multigres cluster apply-rule-change`, which calls
`ApplyCertifiedRuleChange` on Multiorch
([`multiorchservice.proto`](../../proto/multiorchservice.proto)). The
operator supplies the outgoing rule (`--outgoing-rule-term`,
`--outgoing-leader-subterm`) and a `--frozen-lsn`, and by doing so **takes
over the revocation proof** that Multiorch could not obtain: they attest that
no member of the outgoing cohort — including the ones Multiorch cannot reach —
will commit any write past that rule/LSN. If the attestation is wrong (an
unreachable node was the most advanced, or comes back and keeps accepting
writes), committed transactions can be lost. That is exactly why Multiorch
never derives this certificate itself.

`--unsafe-derive-cert-from-reachable` asks multiadmin to probe only the
_proposed_ cohort and derive the outgoing rule and frozen LSN from what it
finds. It is a convenience for when the lost members are known to be
destroyed; it cannot see what those members had, so it carries the data-loss
risk in its name.

The incoming-cohort majority requirement still applies, so two operators
racing to force different outcomes cannot both succeed.
